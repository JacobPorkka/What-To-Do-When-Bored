        <h3><strong>Why going to bed can help with you being bored</strong></h3>
        <p>- Going to bed early is very good for you</p>
        <p>- It can help to clear your mind and think about things in a different way</p>
        <p>- Getting lots of sleep also helps you to have a better day the next day and be full of energy.
        <p>- I do this often when I am bored because I can sleep and wake up being more motivated</p>
